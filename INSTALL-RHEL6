This is the 'INSTALL' file for the rivendell-install package.  It provides
detailed, step-by-step instructions for installing Rivendell on RHEL 6.x
systems.

Please see the 'README' file for an overview and basic rationale for
this package.

INSTALL BASE DISTRIBUTION
-------------------------

RHEL 6
------
The base distribution should be installed in 'Minimal Desktop' mode, which will
result in a basic Gnome 2 desktop environment after the initial
reboot.  Be sure to create an 'rd' user during the install to run
applications.  After logging in as that user, networking can be initialized by
right-clicking on the networking icon in the upper right-hand corner of
the screen and selecting 'Edit Connections'.

Once Internet access is functioning, update the entire installation with
the command:

    yum -y update

Next, reboot the command:

    reboot

The system is now ready to have Rivendell installed.


BOOTSTRAP INSTALLATION SCRIPT
-----------------------------
Log back in as user 'rd' and open a Terminal window (under
Applications->System Tools).  Enter the following command to get 'root'
permissions:

    su -

The system will prompt for a password.  Enter the root password that was
set during system installation (it is normal for the entered password not
to show up as you enter it).

Now enter the following commands:

    wget http://download.paravelsystems.com/CentOS/6/Paravel-Broadcast.repo -P /etc/yum.repos.d/

    wget http://download.paravelsystems.com/CentOS/6/RPM-GPG-KEY-Paravel-Broadcast -P /etc/pki/rpm-gpg

    yum -y install rivendell-install

Then, start the installation with the command:

    ./install_rivendell.sh

Depending upon the speed of the Internet connection, installation can take
between several minutes to an hour or more.


FINISHING UP
------------
After the installation has been completed and the system rebooted, the
system will come back in GUI mode, automatically logged in as user 'rd'.
To secure the system fully, perform the following steps:

1) Set the MySQL administrator password with the following command
   (substitute your password for <pwd> and the name of the system for <host>):

/usr/bin/mysqladmin -u root password '<pwd>'

2) Remove the Rivendell installer script with the following command (as root):

     yum -y remove rivendell-install
